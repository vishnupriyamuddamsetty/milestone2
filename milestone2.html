        <h1><u>Environment</u></h1>
        <p><i>Environmental scientists identify hazards to the environment or to the health of the earth's inhabitants, such as pollution. They also help create solutions to protect the environment by eliminating these hazards, or at least decreasing their harmful effects.</i></p>
        <br><br>
        <p><i>Some of that is changes in their environment, the loss of family and friends, feeling more isolated, and even changes in location, Parrish said. That can include moving to a new city, or to an assisted living facility. The death of a spouse can also increase feelings of isolation.</i></p>
